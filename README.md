# COVID-19 Data Exploration and Insights

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze and derive meaningful insights from confirmed COVID-19 data. The raw data has been sourced from the official website: [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/). The analysis involves using various MySQL queries to understand infection rates and mortality rates of the virus. Additionally, a user-friendly dashboard has been created using Tableau to visually present these insights.

## Introduction
In this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data to extract valuable insights. The analysis covers various metrics such as infection rates, death rates, and the percentage of the population infected by the virus.

## Data Source
The raw data used in this project is obtained from the Our World in Data website, which provides up-to-date and reliable data on COVID-19 confirmed cases and deaths.

## Methodology
The analysis is carried out using several MySQL queries to process and extract meaningful insights from the data. The key steps include:

1. Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
2. Performing SQL queries to calculate various metrics.
3. Visualizing the results using Tableau to create an intuitive dashboard.

## Insights
The project focuses on deriving the following key insights:

- **Percentage of Population Infected**: The percentage of the population infected by COVID-19 in different countries.
- **Total Number of Deaths by Continent**: A breakdown of the total number of deaths across different continents.
- **Global Statistics**: An overview of global COVID-19 statistics, including total confirmed cases and deaths.

## Dashboard
The insights are visualized using a [Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/CovidDashboard_17358320919220/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:sid=&:redirect=auth&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) that provides user-friendly and interactive visualizations of the data. The dashboard allows users to explore the data and gain a better understanding of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact.

## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank Our World in Data for providing the data used in this analysis.
